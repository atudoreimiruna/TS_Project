The narrator describes the significant advancements in newspaper production from the perspective of James M. Goodhue, a potential time-traveler from the era. In Goodhue's time, the web-perfecting press could produce 25,000 impressions per hour, while the linotype machine was capable of setting 6,000 to 10,000 ems per hour. In contrast, the old hand press and hand compositor could only manage 240 impressions and 800 to 1,000 ems per hour, respectively.\n\nThe story then shifts focus to the early days of St. Paul's daily newspapers, which were much smaller in scale than their modern counterparts. A typical newspaper office consisted of a pressman, five or six compositors, two editors, and a business manager. The narrative highlights the challenges faced by early newspaper managers, editors, and compositors.\n\nIn 1857, an election took place in Minnesota to choose delegates for a constitutional convention, aimed at admitting Minnesota as a state.

This historical context sets the stage for the remainder of the story.\n\nAs the election results come in, the division between Republicans and Democrats is so close that when the delegates meet, they hold separate conventions. The contract for printing the proceedings of these conventions is awarded to the two leading papers of the state - the Pioneer and the Minnesotian. The Pioneer is tasked with printing the proceedings of the Democratic body, while the Minnesotian is responsible for printing the proceedings of the Republican convention.\n\nThe contract requires the purchase of considerable materials, so Mr. Moore, the business manager of the Minnesotian, travels to New York to buy a Hoe press, the first one ever brought to the state, as well as a large quantity of type and a Hoe proof press. However, just as the book is about to be completed, an injunction is issued, preventing the Minnesotian from drawing any money from the state until the question of its right to do any state printing is determined by the district court.\n\nMr. Goodrich, the state printer, claims he has the right to print the proceedings of both constitutional bodies, causing great consternation in the Minnesotian office.

Nearly every inhabitant of the city turns out to greet the arrival of the Gray Eagle and Itasca, two of the fastest boats on the river, which are expected to bring the news of the successful laying of the cable.\n\nThe story then moves to Dubuque, Iowa, where two steamboats, the Itasca and the Gray Eagle, are making their way up the Mississippi River. The Itasca starts from Prairie du Chien, while the Gray Eagle departs from St. Paul. As the boats reach a bend in the river, they are abreast of each other, and as they reach the levee, it is difficult to tell which one is ahead. \n\nA passenger on the Gray Eagle throws a copy of the Dubuque Herald, containing the Queen's message, to the shore, and a messenger from the Minnesotian catches it and runs up Bench street to the Minnesotian office. The Minnesotian has the satisfaction of getting out an extra before their competitors.\n\nIn the summer season, the newspapers rely on the steamboats for late Dubuque and Chicago papers for telegraph news. Messengers from the different offices are at the levee, waiting for the boat bringing the newspapers. James J. Hill and the late Gus Borup are also at the levee, awaiting the arrival of the steamers, but they are after copies of the boats' manifest, not in competition with the newspaper offices.\n\nThe Minnesotian is probably the first daily paper in the West to illustrate a local feature. During the summer of 1859, a man named Jackson is lynched by a mob in Wright county, and Gov. Sibley calls out the Pioneer Guards to proceed to the place where the lynching occurred and arrest all persons connected with the tragedy. The Pioneer Guards are the crack military company of the state, and the only service any of its members ever expected to do is in the service of the state.", "\"Mid-19th century St. Paul: Newspapers advance with technology, face financial struggles, compete for scoops, and navigate political turmoil.\"", "\"Mid-19th century St. Paul: Newspapers advance with technology, face financial struggles, compete for scoops, and navigate political turmoil. The story follows the life of a newspaper worker who witnesses the changes in the newspaper industry firsthand. The Minnesotian, a local newspaper, is an important part of the political landscape, and its editor, Dr. Foster, is a powerful figure in the Republican party. Dr. Foster is known for his fiery temper and vigorous writing style. The narrator recounts an incident where Dr. Foster reacts strongly to the execution of John Brown for his attempted raid into Virginia, exclaiming that a man was hung for an idea in the 19th century. Another incident involves Dr. Foster's reaction to the veto of the Homestead Law by President Buchanan. The law, introduced by Galusha A. Grow of Pennsylvania, was a pet measure of the Republican party. Despite the bill passing the house of representatives and the senate with great effort, President Buchanan vetoed the measure, causing Dr. Foster to erupt in anger and rush out into the street, waving the paper and cursing the president.\"", "The story is set in mid-19th century St. Paul, a time of rapid advancements in technology, financial struggles, and intense competition in the newspaper industry. The narrative follows the life of a worker in the newspaper industry, who witnesses the dynamic changes firsthand. The Minnesotian, a local newspaper, plays a significant role in the political landscape of the city. Its editor, Dr. Foster, is a powerful figure in the Republican party, known for his fiery temper and vigorous writing style.\n\nIn the political sphere, tensions are high due to the competition between the three St. Paul daily papers: the Pioneer, Minnesotian, and Times. From 1854 to 1860, these papers engage in a fierce battle to be the first to publish the full text of the president's message. This struggle reaches its peak during the messages of Presidents Pierce and Buchanan, which are lengthy and require extensive preparations. Type is distributed, and all available printers are engaged to help with the extra editions containing the forthcoming message. The employees are offered $2.50 in gold for their efforts, and an oyster supper is provided for the employees of the first paper to publish the message.\n\nIn one notable incident, the proprietor of the Minnesotian attempts to gain an advantage over his competitors by traveling to Red Wing to intercept the mail coach carrying the president's message. However, due to a miscalculation, the message arrives in St. Paul earlier than expected, and the proprietor receives a copy of his own paper containing the complete message before his return.\n\nThe story also highlights the public's interest in contemporary events. In the spring of 1860, people are eager to learn about two significant events: the great prize fight between Heenan and Sayers in England and the meeting of the Democratic national convention in Charleston. The Minnesota Democrats hope that their idol, Stephen A. Douglas, will be nominated for president. The narrator mentions that this fascination with current events is likely still true today.\n\nThroughout this period, the newspapers face financial struggles, and political tensions run high. Dr. Foster, the editor of the Minnesotian, is particularly invested in these issues. His strong reactions to events, such as the execution of John Brown and the veto of the Homestead Law by President Buchanan, demonstrate his passion and commitment to the Republican cause.", "In 1850s St. Paul, newspapers Pioneer, Minnesotian, and Times compete to publish presidential messages first.

The war was not going well for the Union, with McClellan making a precipitous and disastrous retreat from the vicinity of Richmond, the army of Northern Virginia under Pope suffering several severe reverses, and rebel armies in the West under Grant, Buell, and Curtis making no progress toward the heart of the Confederacy.

The sympathies of all the great powers of Europe, save Russia, were manifested by outspoken utterances favorable to the success of the Confederate cause, and rumors of foreign intervention in behalf of the South were daily circulated. The enemies of the government in the North were especially active in their efforts to prevent the enlistment of men under the call of the president, and conspiracies for burning Northern cities had been unearthed by government detectives.
